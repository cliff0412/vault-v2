To borrow, you deposit collateral in the protocol and draw new fyTokens against the collateral.
You may proceed to sell the fyTokens for the underlying token, locking in your borrowing rate. 
Yield Protocol v2 has a built-in automated market maker(AMM) called YieldSpace to enable efficient selling of fyTokens. 
At maturity, you must repay the debt to reclaim your collateral.
After maturity, there is no requirement to close a borrowing position, however, interest is charged to keep the position open. 

Lending in Yield Protocol is as simple as purchasing fyTokens from our YieldSpace AMMs at a discount.  After maturity, lenders may redeem their fyTokens for the underlying token one-to-one.
